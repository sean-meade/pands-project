# Iris Flower Dataset



## Brief description:



The iris flower data set (sometimes referred to as Fisher’s Iris data set) was first encountered in 1936 

in a paper titled The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. In it a man by the name 

Ronald Fisher used measurements of the sepal and petal of three different types of iris flowers 

(Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica). There are 150 sets of measurements each containing the width 

and length of both the sepal and petal (fifty times for each). Figure 1 shows how similar the three 

irises are and indicates where the petal and sepal are on the iris plant.

## So who was Ronald Fisher?

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (to give him his full title) was a British Statistician and Geneticist. Born in 
East Finchley in 1890 Fisher started to show a “special ability” when it came to mathematics at an 
early age. He had also from an early age gained a strong biological interest. As a result, he was 
unsure whether to go into mathematics or biology. Choosing mathematics at Cambridge he came 
across a book by Karl Pearson titled Mathematical contributions to the theory of evolution. After this 
he was interested in problems to do with evolution and genetics.

After University he took up work in an investment company and then moved on to working on a 
farm in Canada, no doubt bored with what would have been simple work for a mathematician of his 
ability. He also tried to join the army in 1914 but was rejected due to his terrible eye sight. For the 
next five years he would teach as a mathematics and physics at various public schools. 

He never lost his interest in mathematics and genetics though and through this time he was 
developing his own ideas. These ideas brought on interest and job offers. From here he had more 
freedom and resources to pursue his work eventually leading him to produce The use of multiple 
measurements in taxonomic problems amongst many others. Fisher despite his natural and 
developed abilities clearly pursued knowledge over financial gain which is what led him to be such 
an influential person in statistics and is considered “the single most important figure in 20th century 
statistics”.[1]

## An in-depth Look at the Data Set:

First off, I think it would help to have a visual representation of the data set. Below is a table 
containing the first 4 rows of the data set and the headings of each column.

The heading of each column (i.e. sepal length, sepal width, petal length etc.) are called attributes. 
You can think of attributes as features each flower has. 

This data set contains 150 rows. This is further split into three. The first 50 are the measurements 
from setosa. The second 50 are from versicolor. The third set of 50 are from virginica.
