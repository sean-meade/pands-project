# Iris Flower Dataset

## Brief description:

The iris flower data set (sometimes referred to as Fisherâ€™s Iris data set) was first encountered in 1936 
in a paper titled The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. In it a man by the name 
Ronald Fisher used measurements of the sepal and petal of three different types of iris flowers 
(Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica). There are 150 sets of measurements each containing the width 
and length of both the sepal and petal (fifty times for each). Figure 1 shows how similar the three 
irises are and also indicates where the petal and sepal are on the iris plant.
