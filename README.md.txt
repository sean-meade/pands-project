# pands-project
Programming and scripting project.

Initial plan and notes:

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it:
    - Check link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris.
    - Google about "Fisher's Iris data set.", collect references (websites) and make notes.

2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project:
    - Create a favourites bar folder and subsequently creat further folders to keep track of references.

3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
    - Download data set and add to repository.
    - Google "best practices for investigating data in Python" make notes and compile list of main common practices. 

4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. 
   A Python script will quickly do this for you.
    - Write code to determine max, min and mean.
    - Google what other features are important when investigating data and how to write Python code for it.

5. Write a summary of your investigations:
    - Google similar investigations and how they were presented.
    - Write a detail report on what was discovered.

6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary:
    - Make a folder in repository for visual references and detail what they show.
    - Add these to report when needed.
