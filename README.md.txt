# pands-project
Programming and scripting project.

Initial plan and notes:

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it:
    X Check link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris.
        -- Downloaded data set, description and index.
        -- The data cotains 3 different types of Iris with measurements of the petals.
    X Google about "Fisher's Iris data set.", collect references (websites) and make notes.
        -- Commonly used in pattern recognition literature.
        -- Created by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher who was a British statistician and geneticist who pioneered the 
        application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments. (https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher)
        -- It includes measurements of both the sepal and petal giving their width and length (include images to
        show what they are on the flowers).
        -- 

2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project:
    X Create a favourites bar folder and subsequently creat further folders to keep track of references.

3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
    X Download data set and add to repository.
    X Google "best practices for investigating data in Python" make notes and compile list of main common practices. 

4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. 
   A Python script will quickly do this for you.
    X Write code to determine max, min and mean.
    X Google what other features are important when investigating data and how to write Python code for it.

5. Write a summary of your investigations:
    X Google similar investigations and how they were presented.
    - Write a detail report on what was discovered.

6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary:
    X Make a folder in repository for visual references and detail what they show.
    - Add these to report when needed.
